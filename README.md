TidyTower: Autonomous Jenga Stack Reconstruction

TidyTower is a robotic system designed to autonomously stack Jenga blocks after a game is over. Using computer vision and precision manipulation, the robot identifies scattered blocks, plans an optimal stacking sequence, and carefully reconstructs the tower. This project explores motion planning, object detection, and robotic grasping to achieve efficient and reliable block stacking.

Features:

    Computer Vision – Detects and localizes fallen Jenga blocks.
    Motion Planning – Calculates optimal pickup and placement paths.
    Robotic Manipulation – Uses a robotic arm and gripper for precise stacking.
    Obstacle Avoidance – Adjusts movements to prevent collisions.

This project aims to enhance automation in structured block stacking tasks and refine robotic dexterity in real-world applications.
